}
\arguments{
\item{.tbl}{data.frame with missing values}

\item{k}{integer, default value 5}

\item{method}{\itemize{
\item "mean" or "random" - do you want to take the mean of the k

\description{
Impute nearest neighbours

\note{
need to add separate functions for knn_avg and knn_rand, and also
scoped variants. Ideally, this should work on a vector first, with
different methods for each part
