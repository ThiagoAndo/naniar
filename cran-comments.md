```
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Tierney (35:36)

Found the following (possibly) invalid file URI:
  URI: bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/6/e007450.full
    From: NEWS.md
```

The first part regarding the spelling of my name - my name is spelt "Tierney", I don't know how to avoid this note.

The second note is regarding the URI for the BMJ Open article, which I have checked multiple times, this seems to be the best link I can find.

## Reverse dependencies
