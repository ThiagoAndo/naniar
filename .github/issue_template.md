Hi there!

Thanks for filing an issue - it would be really helpful for me if you can include a minimal reproducible example (known as a `reprex`) if you have a problem you'd like to tell me about. The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that I can fix it. If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading <https://github.com/jennybc/reprex#what-is-a-reprex>, and follow the advice further down the page.

Please, _Do NOT_ include session info unless it's explicitly asked for, or use`reprex::reprex(..., si = TRUE)` to hide it away.

Delete these instructions once you have read them.
